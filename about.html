            <p>I’m a self proclaimed programming enthusiast, hardware nerd and builder at heart. Prior to Ada, while working as a carpenter at a low-income housing organization, a question of how I could marry the critical thinking logic used in my working life with a budding interest in electrical systems converged into coding.

                I started building basic websites with HTML5 and CSS in 2018 before moving on to JavaScript, Ruby and Python. These tools have progressed into a full-fledged passion for Front End Web Development, Geospatial Technology and Generative Art.
                
                For me, web development has and will always be about having a lasting impact on the communities that raised me. When I’m not in front of a computer, I enjoy mutual aid projects, playing chess, making art and searching for Brooklyn’s best bagel.</p>
